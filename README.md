## Starting files

### index.html

This is just regular HTML, **div id = "app"** is a root element for our app and **index.js** script is bundled app file by webpack.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">

   <head>
      <meta charset = "UTF-8">
      <title>React App</title>
   </head>

   <body>
       <div id = "app"></div>
       <script src = "index.js"></script>
   </body>

</html>
```
