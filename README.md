# Python in a pill
written by Mariusz Szypulski

## First program

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Output:

```python
Hello, World!
```

## Indentations

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

```python
if 1 > 0:
  print("One is greater than zero!")
```
Output:

```python
One is greater than zero!
```
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```python
if 1 > 0:
print("One is greater than zero!")
```

Output:

```python
IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

## Comments

```python
#This is a oneline comment.
```
```python
"""This is a 
multiline comment."""
```
